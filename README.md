2. **Sentiment and Tone Modulation**:
   - By adjusting the `temperature` parameter, Omnibus achieves consistent, contextually appropriate responses.

3. **Prompt Design**:
   - System prompts were carefully crafted to give Omnibus its unique character.
   - This approach demonstrates expertise in **linguistic modeling** and **context management**.

4. **Scalable API Integration**:
   - OpenAI‚Äôs ChatCompletion API ensures seamless interactions.
   - Handles backoff and retry logic for uninterrupted performance.

5. **Debugging and Fine-Tuning**:
   - Extensive testing was conducted to optimize the chatbot‚Äôs accuracy and conversational flow.

6. **Environment Management**:
   - Securely manages API keys with `dotenv`, demonstrating a commitment to data security and scalability.

7. **Deployment Readiness**:
   - The lightweight design ensures adaptability for various platforms, from web apps to mobile integration.
